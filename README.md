Netwhat (42cursus) 2019-2020

- Actual Status : Finished
- Result        : 100%
- Observations : Mainly my research to reply at the MCQ. I know that's can be easy to just read it and use it for the test but use it like complement, make your own research, that will be more usefull. Thanks to [@Mazoise](https://github.com/Mazoise) for the orthographics corrections
